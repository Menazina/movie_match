How you ever wondered?...

How am I going to match a movie with this uncultural being I call my friend?, lets stop the suffering!, we bring to you: 

The Match me a Movie! (Against dummies)

The rules:

You choose the movies you liked and enjoyed watching, and let us know which kind of movies you would like to watch in the future, we offer you new suggestions, while we do the same for your gamer_2 and we let you know your match!

So you save time and headaches spending time figuring which movie you would like to watch with your friend.

## Data Preparation

### Overview:

* My dataset talks about movies, names, best ranked, genres, directors, actors, metascore. All valuable information to see which one fit you the best.
* I obtained it from kaggle.
	* https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows
* The complexity for cleaning the data was okay, I did a couple before keeping one I liked.


### Data Wrangling and Cleaning

* Cleaning data is one of my favourites step of the bootcamp. I like to check null, what to do with them, how to manage them, how to create or eliminate columns and use data tools to best clean the data.
* All my documnetation is in the Movie IMDB dataset.

### Data Storage

## Data Analysis

### Overview

I want to be able to give my code a movie I really like and that it returns me a list of movies that do a match for me.


## Conclusion

* My objective on this project was to proof that IÂ´m able to a model of recommendations based on Data, where I can clean the Data, and take decisions over the results I see.
During the process I passed some difficulties since coding was the hard part for me, to ask the program what I needed to. Several times I runed the same code and wondered why its not running the way I want it.
As a designer and marketing person my main goal is visualization, so this project has being a challenge, has not being up to standards of visualization I like, so my next step is to make an UX/UI app about this program.
