# Match me a movie!


My final project for my Ironhack bootcamp in Data Analysis, Mexico City. 

How you ever wondered?...

How am I going to match a movie with this uncultural being I call my friend?, lets stop the suffering!, we bring to you: 

The Match me a Movie! (Against dummies)

The rules:

You choose the movies you liked and enjoyed watching, and let us know which kind of movies you would like to watch in the future, we offer you new suggestions, while we do the same for your gamer_2 and we let you know your match!

So you save time and headaches spending time figuring which movie you would like to watch with your friend.

Challenges:
(updated the 24th of September)

1. Do the prediction of movies based on: metascore and genre per user.
